## Setup

Requirements: 

- Xcode 10.1
- [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint)
- [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org)

To set up the project, open terminal in MeditationAppShowcase folder and run `pod install`.

## Run

Open `MeditationAppShowcase.xcworkspace` and run production scheme in a chosen simulator. If you want to run the app on a real device, you need to update code signing configuration first.

## Some implementation details

- 100% unit-testable code
- There are no code library dependencies, only swiftLint for helping to keep the code clean
- MVVP design architecture
- All dependencies are being protocol-injected via simple dependency container
- The `Business logic` is fully separated from `View logic`. The business logic is performed in viewModels, child viewModels and helpers, and view logic in viewControllers and it's childs / subviews
- Most of the subviews and it's interesting autolayout constraints are exposed to the interface so the animations can be implemented in decorators
- The `Observer design pattern` is realized by generic `EventEmitter<T>` [MeditationViewModel+Data.swift](⁨⁨⁨⁨⁨⁨MeditationAppShowcase⁩/Commons/Utilities/Observer/EventEmitter.swift).
- Data on play list are mocked up in [MeditationViewModel+Data.swift](⁨⁨⁨⁨⁨⁨MeditationAppShowcase⁩/Screens⁩/Meditation⁩/MeditationViewModel+Data.swift) file
